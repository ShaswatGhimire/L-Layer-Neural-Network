# L-Layer-Neural-Network
## implementation of L layer neural network from scratch

This project uses a L-layer neural network to classify data .. train and predict using sigmoid and relu activation

Dataset used - Dogs vs Cats classifier (KAGGLE) https://www.kaggle.com/shaunthesheep/microsoft-catsvsdogs-dataset

Accuracy is not that since CNN would have worked best... but we all start someplace aye!!!  
will do hyperparameter tuning when able and increase it's efficiency as much as possible.
